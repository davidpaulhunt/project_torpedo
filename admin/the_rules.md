## This page is for our authors ONLY. It is meant to list out some simple suggestions so as to not step on each other's toes.

We should write each piece in our own branch with names that are alike. I suggest using a format like this

```sectionname_authorname e/g ruby_david```

That way, we can identify branches by their content first then by who wrote it. This works well because the subject and content matters more than who wrote it.
