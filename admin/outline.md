# Project Torpedo Outline

## The Plan

The best way to do is by learning!! So, in this resource we're going to train anyone to build a Rails application. Of course, we know there are hundreds of resources out there (most of which are free!), but having spent the last year or so learning Rails, it has become obvious that none of those resources tie it all together in a way that leaves the new developer with a ready-to-go application. If you're looking for in-depth technical knowledge, this resource isn't for you. However, if you're relatively new, or absolutely new, this is the resource you've been waiting for!
