## This page is for our authors ONLY. It is meant to list out some simple suggestions so as to not step on each other's toes.

### Branches

We should write each piece in our own branch with names that are alike. I suggest using a format like this

```sectionname_authorname e/g ruby_david```

That way, we can identify branches by their content first then by who wrote it. This works well because the subject and content matters more than who wrote it.

### Consistency

Let's try to ensure the entire book is a consistent user story. As in, if the order isn't working or we should have done something earlier, we should go back and write it into the flow. We want a consistent path for readers to move from know-nothing to using the technology.

This isn't a book, it's a resource! I'm sure we'll be updating this for quite some time. In fact, that's one of the beauties of what we're aiming to do: provide a reliable springboard for new Rails' enthusiasts. On that note, let's empower our readers because from the moment they use that rails new command, they're a developer!

### Make It Work, Make It Better

We all know there are dozens of ways to do just about anything in programming, and that's especially true in Rails. That being the case, the path we carve should be the shortest distance from point A to point B. Point A is staring at the keyboard and point B is navigating a functioning Rails application of their own making.
